# ~sammcd

Inspired by [Sam Soffes](https://github.com/soffes/dotfiles)

## Environment

I am running on Mac OS X. You'll need to switch to ZSH with the following command:

    $ chsh -s /bin/zsh

## Installation

    $ git clone git@github.com:sammcd/dotfiles.git
    $ ./linkfiles.sh

## Stuff To Change

**Please change the `.gitconfig` so you don't commit everything as me.** Everything else shouldn't need tweaking.
